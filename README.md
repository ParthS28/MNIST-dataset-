# MNIST-dataset

This repository contains a neural network to build a digit classifier from scratch. 

# Note
I wanted to check how the model performed gradually with more data I gave to it, that is why I have trained it batchwise.

This neural network took a long time to train, so if you have a suggestion for an optimization, please do let me know :)

# Update
I have uploaded a solution to this problem using keras, so feel free to play around with it.
